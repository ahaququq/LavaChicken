## What is it?

It's a simple "game engine" based on the Vulkan graphics API.
Currently, I have no idea if anything comes out of it

## Goals:
- [x] Get `vulkan.hpp` to work
- [x] Get a window to show up
  - [ ] Make it render on Wayland
- [ ] Show a triangle

## What will not happen:
- Anything on non-linux devices
