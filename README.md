## What is it?

It's a simple "game engine" based on the Vulkan graphics API.
Currently, I have no idea if anything comes out of it

## Goals:
- [x] Get `vulkan.hpp` to work
- [x] Get a window to show up
  - [x] Make it render on Wayland
- [x] Show a triangle
- [ ] Get perspective working
- [ ] Load a more interesting test mesh
- [ ] Make it rotate
- [ ] Generate an interesting mesh

## What will not happen:
- Anything on non-linux devices (it may work, but compile it yourself, it may require some work)
